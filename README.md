# COMP6247-coursework-dynamic-maze
This project comes from one part of coursework in COMP6247 - Reinforcement and Online Learning.
The purpose of this part is to adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) technique to solving a dynamic maze problem to compute the minimum time path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the maze.

The maze's size is 200x200, and the only way the agent is able to get the maze information is surrounding observation. Every time the agent observe the maze will generate fire in surround randomly.
